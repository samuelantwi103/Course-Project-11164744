# Course Project

## Overview:

This project involves the analysis of the Red Wine dataset, focusing on understanding the relationships between chemical attributes and the quality of red wines. The dataset provides information on various factors such as acidity, alcohol content, and sulfur dioxide measures for a collection of red wines, along with quality ratings.

## Project Structure:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted a thorough exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, data types, and basic statistics.
   - Visualized the distribution of key features through histograms.
   - Analyzed pairplots and correlation matrices to identify potential relationships between attributes.

2. **Attribute Analysis:**
   - Examined specific attributes, including alcohol content, acidity measures, density, residual sugar, sulfur dioxide measures, chlorides, and sulphates.
   - Investigated how these attributes varied across different quality levels.

3. **Scatter Plots and Multivariate Analysis:**
   - Utilized scatter plots to visualize relationships between pairs of attributes.
   - Introduced multivariate analysis by considering varying wine qualities in scatter plots for alcohol content and fixed acidity.

4. **Statistical Modeling:**
   - Applied statistical methods to uncover patterns and correlations within the dataset.
   - Explored potential outliers and unique instances in the data.

## Key Findings:

1. **Alcohol Content and Quality:**
   - Identified a positive correlation between alcohol content and wine quality.

2. **Acidity Measures:**
   - Explored variations in fixed acidity and observed a negative correlation between volatile acidity and quality.

3. **Density and Residual Sugar:**
   - Recognized a complex relationship between density and residual sugar.

4. **Sulfur Dioxide Measures:**
   - Found a proportional relationship between free sulfur dioxide and total sulfur dioxide.

5. **Chlorides and Sulphates:**
   - Identified a complex and non-linear relationship between chlorides and sulphates.

6. **Multivariate Analysis:**
   - Visualized the interplay between alcohol content, fixed acidity, and wine quality by considering varying quality levels.

## Conclusion:

The project provides valuable insights into the factors influencing red wine quality. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the complex relationships between chemical attributes and their impact on wine quality. Further research, including advanced statistical modeling and the incorporation of additional factors, can enhance the depth of understanding in the field of winemaking.
